# 1.email validation in python (using string functions)
   -  Certainly! You can also perform basic email validation using string functions without 
       relying on regular expressions. 
   -    In this program,
   -    first input from user.
   -    checks if the email contains exactly minimum six character,
   -    checks if the email contains exactly first latter alphabets,
   -    checks if the email contains exactly one '@' character,
   -    checks if the email contains exactly '.' is end with third or fourth position 
   -    checks if the email contains exactly  not space in character
    
# 2.email validation in python (using RegEx)   
 - Certainly! You can use regular expressions to perform email validation in Python. Here's an example using the re (regular expression) module ..
 -  condition:-
        -  a - z (isalpha)
        -  0-9 (num)
        -  . _ ( at time 1)
        -  @ (at time 1)
       -  . (revsers -3,-4 position)
  - Define a regular expression 'email_condition' for a basic email validation
  - Define a regular expression 'user_email' for a basic email validation 
  - Use re.search() to check if the email matches the 'email_condition','user_email'.
  - This example uses the re.search() function to check if the provided email adheres to a basic pattern for email addresses.
